# Make-QR-Code-Generator-Website-

### I learned how to create a QR code generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code works by taking the text or link entered by the user and converting it into a QR code that can be easily downloaded. It uses a JavaScript library specialized in generating QR codes, combined with a simple design to enhance the user experience.
